# CV_Efficiency_MetaRobustness

Initially, this project was supposed to be my personal AP® Research project, yet it turned into a full learning journey in the world of (La)TeX, academic practices, and notably code.

## What is the objective of this paper?

Although the world has revolutionized around the Transformer architecture, it is always a good practice to step back on older technologies or utilizations. One is typically surrounded by chatbots—after all, that's what we're closest to. It is in all architectures, however, that many energetical concerns arise. This project aims to minimize energy consumption of an image-classifying neural network through meta-learning and model-agnostic cognitive robustness means.
